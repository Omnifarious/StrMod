	* distbin/proclibsrc.pl.in: Added this multipurpose perl script to
	help all the depency collection and filtering to the top level
	make file work.

	* distbin/install-sh: Added this program so that configure would
	always find a BSD compatible install.

	* Makefile.in: Added the wondrous, splendiferous new makefile that
	runs through all the component directories, collects depency
	information, and does one, big make at the top level.

	* configure.in: Added configure.in.  It doesn't really do much yet
	besides set up paths and things, but hopefully that will change.

	* GNUmakefile: Removed because now there's Makefile.in
