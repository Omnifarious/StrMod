	* Makefile.in: Added the wondrous, splendiferous new makefile that
	runs through all the component directories, collects depency
	information, and does one, big make at the top level.

	* configure.in: Added configure.in.  It doesn't really do much yet
	besides set up paths and things, but hopefully that will change.

	* GNUmakefile: Removed because now there's Makefile.in
