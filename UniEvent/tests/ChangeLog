2002-03-13  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.org>

	* testupoll.cxx: The test works now.  Removed code to chop newline

	does it.

	library makefile.

	* testsig.cxx: A testing harness that works, though it uses a
	cheesy sleep event as an onQueueEmpty event to get around a
	problem in SimpleDispatcher.

	* testdisp.h: Removed a reference to my badly thought out <bool.h>
	header file.

	* testUPoll.cxx:

	lowercase' naming conventions.

Mon May 12 20:04:21 1997  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* munchdisptest.pl: Changed to print out more standard success and
 	failure messages, and to check the new construction and
 	destruction counts.

	* testdisp.cxx: Changed test to use new EventPtr classes, and also
 	do construction and destruction counting to make sure reference
 	counting is working.
