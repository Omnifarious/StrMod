	* munchdisptest.pl: Changed to print out more standard success and
 	failure messages, and to check the new construction and
 	destruction counts.

	* testdisp.cxx: Changed test to use new EventPtr classes, and also
 	do construction and destruction counting to make sure reference
 	counting is working.
