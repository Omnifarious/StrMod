1999-11-18  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* Everything: Added copyright notices everywhere!

1999-10-20  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/Dispatcher.h:
	* UniEvent/SimpleDispatcher.h:
	* UniEvent/UNEVT_ClassIdent.h:
	* UniEvent/UNIXpollManager.h:
	* UniEvent/UNIXpollManagerImp.h:
	* SimpleDispatcherImp.cxx:
	* UNIXpollManagerImp.cxx: Removed all references to <bool.h> and
	changed all references to bool_val and bool_cst to bool.
	
	* GNUmakefile.in: Removed because now there's Makefile.in

	* Makefile.in: Added the wondrous, splendiferous new makefile that
	reports a list of dependencies to the root level makefile so one,
	big make can be done at the top level.

1999-10-15  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* GNUmakefile.in: Updated to be have everything the GNUmakefile has.

1999-07-20  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/UNEVT_ClassIdent.h: Removed a redundant operator ==
	that was only there because some C++ compilers had a hard time
	properly resolving the operator == that took base class types.

	* UniEvent/UNIXpollManagerImp.h: Added a #define of __USE_XOPEN to
	ensure that Linux defines the full set of poll flags.

1999-01-31  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UNIXpollManagerImp.cxx (doPoll): Changed to handle possible
	EINTR return code, indicating that the poll was interrupted by a
	signal.  Some operating systems (AIX v.? and DGUX v.4.0D)
	interrupt poll with a signal, even if the signal handler has the
	SA_RESTART flag set.

1999-01-10  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/EventPtrT.h (i_CheckType): Added a NULL check.  Not
	sure if it is right though.

	* UniEvent/UNIXError.h: Added a destructor and AreYouA function
	that were accidentally missing before.

	* UNIXError.cxx: Added an identifier so this class is part of my
	RTTI system.

	* UNEVT_ClassIdent.cxx: Added the UNIXError class to the list.

1998-08-29  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/UNIXError.h: 
	* UNIXError.cxx: Added UNIXError class for encapsulating errno
	values nicely.

Mon May 19 10:51:25 1997  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/OSConditionManager.h
	(OSConditionManager::WaitConditions): Realized that WaitConditions
 	needed to know which dispatcher to post events to.

	* UniEvent/StandCondManager.h:
	* UniEvent/StandObConditions.h:
	* StandCondManager.cxx:
	* StandObConditions.cxx: Added new classes to implement some
 	standard ConditionManger and ObjectConditions functionality.


Sun May 18 18:28:35 1997  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/OSObjectConditions.h: 
	* UniEvent/Dispatcher.h: 
	* UniEvent/OSConditionManager.h: Firmed up interface for
 	OSConditionManager, and OSObjectConditions classes, and related
 	member functions in other classes.

	* OSObjectConditions.cxx: Added to make place for inline member
 	functions and identifier constant to be.

	* UNEVT_ClassIdent.cxx: Added new comment for OSObjectConditions
	class.

Mon May 12 19:58:59 1997  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/EventPtr.h:
	* UniEvent/EventPtrT.h:
	* EventPtr.cxx: Added new EventPtr classes to maintain reference
 	count on UNIEvent classes.

	* UniEvent/Event.h:
	* UniEvent/Dispatcher.h:
	* UniEvent/SimpleDispatcher.h:
	* SimpleDispatcherImp.cxx:
	* UNEVT_ClassIdent.cxx: Various changes to make UNIEvent a
 	reference counted class, and to add (and use) new Ptr types to
 	automatically maintain the reference count.

Wed Apr 16 13:07:08 1997  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/OSConditionManager.h:
	* OSConditionManager.cxx: Added new class for managing OS
	conditions that can trigger events.

Sun Apr  6 10:28:31 1997  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* GNUmakefile.in: Added new library CCs, a framework for tests,
	and a clean target.

	* UniEvent/Dispatcher.h (class UNIDispatcher): Added explanatory
 	comment so I wouldn't try to smooth a needed rough edge out of the
 	design again.

	* UniEvent/SimpleDispatcher.h (class UNISimpleDispatcher): Removed
 	OSConditionManager accessor because there's no sense in having the
 	exact same implementation in several places in the inheritance
 	hierarchy.

Tue Mar 11 15:29:55 1997  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/SimpleDispatcher.h: 
	* UniEvent/Dispatcher.h: 
	* SimpleDispatcherImp.cxx: Added new 'enclosing' parameter to
	dispatching funtions in order to allow for dispatchers implemented
	in terms of other dispatchers.

Sun Mar  9 08:13:56 1997  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/Event.h (constructor): Added default constructor after
 	realizing copy constructor suppressed automatically generated
 	default.

Sat Mar  8 09:29:44 1997  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/SimpleDispatcher.h:
	* SimpleDispatcherImp.cxx:
	* SimpleDispatcher.cxx: Added UNISimpleDispatcher class, which is
	a simple STL based event dispatcher.

	* UniEvent/Event.h: Removed useless include of <bool.h>.  Added
	alternate method of calling TriggerEvent to class UNIEvent.

	* UniEvent/Dispatcher.h (constructor): Added default constructor
 	after realizing copy constructor suppressed automatically
 	generated default.
	(class UNIDispatcher): Changed bool_ret, to use bool_val typedef
	instead.

Mon Mar  3 00:25:14 1997  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/Event.h: Fixed stupid errors.

	* UniEvent/Dispatcher.h: Fixed stupid errors.

Sun Mar  2 23:17:54 1997  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* UniEvent/Event.h: First cut at definition for abstract UNIEvent
 	class.

	* UniEvent/Dispatcher.h: First cut at definition for abstract
	UNIDispatcher class.
