	* GNUmakefile.in: Removed because now there's Makefile.in

	* Makefile.in: Added the wondrous, splendiferous new makefile that
	reports a list of dependencies to the root level makefile so one,
	big make can be done at the top level.

	* EHnet++/NET_ClassIdent.h: Removed a redundant operator == that
	was only there because some C++ compilers had a hard time properly
	resolving the operator == that took base class types.

	* EHnet++/InetAddress.h:
	* InetAddress.cxx:
	* InetAddrNetDB.cxx: More changes to make things more type correct.

	* InedtAddrNetDB.cxx (NameToIaddr): Fixed to be more compatible
	with what the hostent structure actually contains.

	* InetAddrNetDB.cxx:
	* EHnet++/InetAddress.h:
	* InetAddress.cxx: Changed some method signatures to use unsigned
	int & instead of unsigned long &.  This is because now that
	architectures are 32/64 bit, int is more likely to be 32 bits.
