	* InetAddrNetDB.cxx (NameToIaddr): Fixed to be more compatible
	with what the hostent structure actually contains.

	* InetAddrNetDB.cxx:
	* EHnet++/InetAddress.h:
	* InetAddress.cxx: Changed some method signatures to use unsigned
	int & instead of unsigned long &.  This is because now that
	architectures are 32/64 bit, int is more likely to be 32 bits.
