<h1 class="title">The StreamModule Subsystem</h1>

<h2>General Description</h2>

<p>StreamModule's provide a facility For building a program out of small
components that are connected by a bidirectional streams of data. There are
many programs that fit this model, or have large pieces that fit this model.
One example is the <em>tokenizer -&gt; preprocessor -&gt; compiler -&gt;
optimizer -&gt; assembler</em> chain for traditional compilation of a C
program. Another is the <em>wire &lt;-&gt; ethernet &lt;-&gt; IP &lt;-&gt;
TCP &lt;-&gt; socket &lt;-&gt; apache</em> chain for an http connnection to a
webserver.</p>

<p>Though the entire StreamModule system is designed such that many of its
individual pieces can be used independently, the StreamModule subsystem is
its heart. The other pieces are mainly designed to provide a supporting
framework for this piece.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>StreamModules and StreamModule::Plugs</h3>

<p>StreamModule's are connected by StreamModule::Plug objects. These objects
are created by a StreamModule, and are owned by that module. They can be
plugged into other plugs from other modules. Each plug is created on a 'side'
of the StreamModule.</p>

<h3>Sides</h3>

<p>A side is always identified by an integer. Usually only a small range of
integer values are valued, and a StreamModule class will usually have an enum
inside it detailing all the valid values side may take.</p>

<p>A side represents a protocol role. Now, that's kind of an airy
description, and here's what it really means.</p>

<p>A StreamModule can be thought of as a processor of data with multiple
inputs and outputs and its own internal state. A side represets a distinct IO
stream for this data processor. Some processors have the job of taking in one
copy of the data on one side, and making many copies on the other side. The
side on which many copies are made is just one side because the copies are
indistinguishable, but there are still multiple plugs on that side because
there are multiple outputs, even if any given output is indistinguishable
from another.</p>

<p>Since a StreamModule bears a strong resemblance to a component in a Unix
pipeline, here are a few examples from the Unix world: <dl>
  <dt><code>grep</code></dt>
    <dd><code>grep</code> has three sides. One side takes a file, and the
      other spits out the matching lines, and the last spits out error
      messages.</dd>
  <dt><code>sh</code></dt>
    <dd><code>sh</code>, when used to run a shellscript, has four sides. The
      first side is <code>stdin</code>, the second, <code>stdout</code>, the
      third <code>stderr</code>, and the last is the file containing the
      shellscript.</dd>
  <dt><code>tee</code></dt>
    <dd><code>tee</code> has three sides. The first is the input side, the
      second, the output side (which has multiple 'plugs' because tee writes
      its output to multiple places) and the error side on which tee write
      error messages.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h3>Moving data between StreamModules</h3>

<p>StreamModule::Plugs move <a href="StrChunk.html">StrChunk</a>s around using
 eachothers <a
 href="../doxygen/classstrmod_1_1strmod_1_1StreamModule_1_1Plug.html#b11">i_Read</a>
 and <a
 href="../doxygen/classstrmod_1_1strmod_1_1StreamModule_1_1Plug.html#b12">i_Write</a>
 methods to pull data from, and push data into another StreamModule.  These
 methods are protected.  StreamModule::Plugs use their internal 'readable' and
 'writeable' state to determine when these methods are called.</p>
