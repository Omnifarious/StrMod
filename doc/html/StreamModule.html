<h1 class="title">The StreamModule Subsystem</h1>

<p>StreamModule's provide a facility For building a program out of small
components that are connected by a bidirectional streams of data. There are
many programs that fit this model, or have large pieces that fit this model.
One example is the <em>tokenizer -&gt; preprocessor -&gt; compiler -&gt;
optimizer -&gt; assembler</em> chain for traditional compilation of a C
program. Another is the <em>wire &lt;-&gt; ethernet &lt;-&gt; IP &lt;-&gt;
TCP &lt;-&gt; socket &lt;-&gt; apache</em> chain for an http connnection to a
webserver.</p>

<p>Though the StreamModule system is designed such that many of its
individual pieces can be used independently, the StreamModule subsystem is
its heart. The other pieces are mainly designed to provide a supporting
framework for this piece.</p>
