<h1 class="title">What the heck is a <a
href="../doxygen/classstrmod_1_1strmod_1_1StrChunk.html">StrChunk</a>?</h1>

<p>A StrChunk is an abstraction for an immutable byte string. One might think
such an abstraction wouldn't be very complicated or deserving of a detailed
explanation, but StrChunk's are a bit different.</p>

<p>One of the chief problems in moving data around is the time it takes to
make copies. Each copy made of a buffer of data is a waste of memory
bandwidth. Often memory bandwidth is even more scarce than CPU speed,
especially in programs who's main job it is to move data around. These copies
happen because protocols often have sections of messages that contain random
data that's not of direct concern to a particular protocol layer. The common
strategy is to copy the data that's of concern to the next layer out of the
message, and throw the original data and layer wrappings away. StrChunks
provide a better way.</p>

<p>A StrChunk is an abstraction for an immutable byte string. Ths means that
the underlying implementation need not actually be a byte string. In fact,
two common kinds of StrChunks (StrSubChunks and GroupChunks) use StrChunks
for their implementation. This sounds pretty simple, but has some interesting
implications.</p>

<p>Another concept that needs introduction is the idea of a <a
href="../doxygen/classstrmod_1_1strmod_1_1LinearExtent.html">LinearExtent</a>. A
LinearExtent is actually rather simple, and perhaps a better name could be
thought of. It consists of a starting point or offset, and a length. It is
used to refer to portions of a StrChunk.</p>

<dl><dt><h2>StrSubChunks and <a
href="../doxygen/classstrmod_1_1strmod_1_1LinearExtent.html">LinearExtent</a>s</h2></dt>

<dd><p>A StrSubChunk is a StrChunk that uses another StrChunk to actually
implement the byte string. It uses a LinearExtent to describe which portion
of the child StrChunk the StrSubChunk consists of. This sounds kind of
confusing, but the idea is simple.</p>

<p>Suppose you create a StrChunk like this:<br />
<pre>BufferChunk *pab1 = new PreAllocBuffer&lt;23&gt;; // Using a BufferChunk * because we need getVoidP()
memcpy(pab1-&gt;getVoidP(), "George Orwell has fleas", 23); // from BufferChunk to finish the StrChunk.</pre>
<br />
<code>*pab1</code> now contains this sequence of bytes:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Offset</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>13</td>
      <td>14</td>
      <td>15</td>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>17</td>
      <td>18</td>
      <td>19</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>21</td>
      <td>22</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Value</th>
      <td>G</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>o</td>
      <td>r</td>
      <td>g</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>O</td>
      <td>r</td>
      <td>w</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>l</td>
      <td>l</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>s</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>f</td>
      <td>l</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>s</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br />


<p>If you created a StrSubChunk that had a LinearExtent of (offset: 7,
length: 10) like this:<br />
<pre>StrChunk *subc = new StrSubChunk(pab1, LinearExtent(7, 10));</pre>
<br />
and used <code>*pab1</code> to hold the bytes, this StrSubChunk (which is
also itself a StrChunk) would look like this:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Offset</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Value</th>
      <td>O</td>
      <td>r</td>
      <td>w</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>l</td>
      <td>l</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>s</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br />


<p>As you can see, a new StrChunk has been created that contains part of
another StrChunk without having to have made a copy of that part.</p>
</dd>

<dt><h2>GroupChunks</h2></dt>

<dd><p>A GroupChunk is a kind of StrChunk that can contain several other
StrChunks. A GroupChunk appears as the concatenation of all the StrChunks it
contains. Suppose you have two StrChunks:<br/>
<pre>
BufferChunk *bc1 = new PreAllocBuffer&lt;10>;
memcpy(pa1->getVoidP(), "What hath ", 10);
BufferChunk *bc2 = new PreAllocBuffer&lt;12>;
memcpy(pa1->getVoidP(), "God wrought?", 12);
</pre><br/>
<code>*bc1</code> contains:

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Offset</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Value</th>
      <td>W</td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>t</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>t</td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

and <code>*bc2</code> contains:

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Offset</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>11</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Value</th>
      <td>G</td>
      <td>o</td>
      <td>d</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>w</td>
      <td>r</td>
      <td>o</td>
      <td>u</td>
      <td>g</td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>t</td>
      <td>?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>

<p>Then, suppose you create a new GroupChunk and add these two StrChunks to
it. A GroupChunk is a StrChunk, so, from a StrChunk perspective, the new
GroupChunk contains:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Offset</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>13</td>
      <td>14</td>
      <td>15</td>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>17</td>
      <td>18</td>
      <td>19</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>21</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Value</th>
      <td>W</td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>t</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>t</td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>G</td>
      <td>o</td>
      <td>d</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>w</td>
      <td>r</td>
      <td>o</td>
      <td>u</td>
      <td>g</td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>t</td>
      <td>?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This allows you to 'virtually' concatenate StrChunks together without
having to make any copies.</p>

<p>You can combine StrSubChunks and GroupChunks together to do anything you
would with C character arrays and pointers without having to actually move
any of your data bytes around. Better yet, these entities are reference
counted, immutable after creation, don't treat <code>'\0'</code> differently,
and are resistant to buffer overflows.</p>
