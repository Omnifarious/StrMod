<h1 class="title">Tutorial</h1>

<p>For a tutorial, we're going to write a program I call a <em>port
forwarder</em>. Our port forwarder will accept incoming connections on one
TCP/IP port (port 1), or socket, and makes matching outgoing connections to a
different port (port 2). It then sends any data sent to port 1 to port 2, and
any data sent to port 2 to port 1. The net effect is a program that seems to
make one resource (like www.microsoft.com port 80) to also appear at another
place (like fred.omnifarious.org port 3000).</p>

<p>I use the program we will write to make specific tunnels around firewalls.
I also use it to send IRC connections through an encrypted IP tunnel to my
computer at home, then forward them to their eventual destination.</p>

<p>Here's a diagram of a typical running PortForward session:</p>
