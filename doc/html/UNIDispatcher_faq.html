  <dt><h2>Overview</h2>
  </dt>
    <dd><dl>
        <dt><h3>What the heck's a UNIDispatcher?</h3>
        </dt>
          <dd><p>A UNIDispatcher is an interface class the provides simple
            event dispatching capabilities.  It has methods (that subclasses
            must implement) to allow you to add events to its queue, and
            methods that cause it to 'fire' one or more of these events.</p>
          </dd>
        <dt><h3>What's a UNIEvent?</h3>
        </dt>
          <dd><p>A UNIEvent is the object that the UNIDispatcher holds in a
            qeue and 'fires' by calling its <a
            href="../classdoc/UNIEvent.html#TriggerEvent(UNIDispatcher*dispatcher=0)">TriggerEvent</a>
            method.  It behaves a little like a function pointer that's
            pointing at a function that takes as an argument the dispatcher
            that fired the event.  UNIEvents are supposed to be re-used, and
            not created individually for each event. That's why they inherit
            from ReferenceCounting and have the UNIEventPtr type.</p>
          </dd>
        <dt><h3>Why would I use an implementation of UNIDispatcher?</h3>
        </dt>
          <dd><p>This is a complicated question.  The short answer is that
            you'd use it when you need to use events to communicate between
            different parts of your program.</p>
            <p>Of course, this begs the question of why you'd use events
            instead of simple function call, so here are a list of
            reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The function you're calling may do something to the object
                you're calling it from that's hard to deal with. (i.e. In the
                place where the call would normally be made, your class
                invariant might be false.)</li>
              <li>You may not want the function call to be carried out right
                away, in order to give other things a chance to do stuff.</li>
              <li>The function you want to call may be part of an object that
                logically belongs in a different thread, and you want the call
                to occur in the control flow of that thread to avoid locking
                issues.</li>
              <li>You may not have any good way of actually figuring out which
                function you need to call on which object.</li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
        <dt><h3>So, what's this got to do with the StreamModule sytem?</h3>
        </dt>
          <dd><p>There are a few ways in which the UNIEvent subsystem is used
            in the StreamModule system.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The UNIXPollManager uses events to notify interested parties
                about the state of file descriptors.</li>
              <li>The SimpleMultiplexer uses events to give other things a
                chance to run.  This is so one stream can't hog the
                many-to-one direction of the multiplexer.</li>
              <li>The StreamFDModule will be changed to use events to notify
                interested parties about error conditions.</li>
              <li>When signal handling is finished, the signal handler will
                use events to fold signals back into the normal flow of
                control.</li>
              <li>When multi-threading is supported, and the InterThreadModule
                is done, the InterThreadModule will use events to notify
                itself (in the proper thread context) about items on the
                queue.</li>
              <li>Modules that need to destroy themselves (or the modules they
                communicate with) will post an event, and the event will do
                the destruction in order to avoid having this pointers on the
                stack that point to a dead object.</li>
            </ul>
          </dd>

  <dt><h2>Tutorial</h2>
  </dt>
    <dd><p>In order to show you some uses of UNIDispatcher that actually make
      sense, other facilities, like the UNIXpollManager need to be explained.
      Look for examples there.</p>
