<p>All classes that are part of the Dispatcher subsystem are in the
strmod::unievent namespace.</p>

  <dt><h2>Overview</h2>
  </dt>
    <dd><dl>
        <dt><h3>What the heck's a <a
        href="../doxygen/classstrmod_1_1unievent_1_1Dispatcher.html">Dispatcher</a>?</h3>
        </dt>
          <dd><p>A Dispatcher is an interface class the provides simple event
            dispatching capabilities. It has methods (that subclasses must
            implement) to allow you to add events to its queue, and methods
            that cause it to 'fire' one or more of these events.</p>
          </dd>
        <dt><h3>What's an <a
        href="../doxygen/classstrmod_1_1unievent_1_1Event.html">Event</a>?</h3>
        </dt>
          <dd><p>An Event is the object that the Dispatcher holds in a queue
            and 'fires' by calling its <a
            href="../doxygen/classstrmod_1_1unievent_1_1Event.html#a3">TriggerEvent</a>
            method. It behaves a little like a function pointer that's
            pointing at a function that takes as an argument the dispatcher
            that fired the event. Events are supposed to be re-used, and not
            created individually for each event. That's why they inherit from
            strmod::lcore::ReferenceCounting and have the EventPtr type.</p>
          </dd>
        <dt><h3>Why would I use an implementation of Dispatcher?</h3>
        </dt>
          <dd><p>This is a complicated question. The short answer is that
            you'd use it when you need to use events to communicate between
            different parts of your program.</p>
            <p>Of course, this begs the question of why you'd use events
            instead of simple function call, so here are a list of reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>The function you're calling may do something to the object
                you're calling it from that's hard to deal with. (i.e. In the
                place where the call would normally be made, your class
                invariant might be false.)</li>
              <li>You may not want the function call to be carried out right
                away, in order to give other things a chance to do stuff.</li>
              <li>The function you want to call may be part of an object that
                logically belongs in a different thread, and you want the
                call to occur in the control flow of that thread to avoid
                locking issues.</li>
              <li>You may not have any good way of knowing, when you write
                your class, which function you need to call on which object.
                You can use an event as sort of a function pointer that will
                be queued up to be called whenever you need to call your
                function. The new Java AWT and Swing frameworks, for example,
                turn a GUI button press into an event.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          </dd>
        <dt><h3>So, what's this got to do with the StreamModule sytem?</h3>
        </dt>
          <dd><p>There are a few ways in which the Dispatcher subsystem is
            used in the StreamModule system.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The <a
                href="../doxygen/classstrmod_1_1unievent_1_1UNIXpollManager.html">UNIXPollManager</a>
                uses events to notify interested parties about the state of
                file descriptors.</li>
              <li>The <a
                href="../doxygen/classstrmod_1_1strmod_1_1SimpleMultiplexer.html">SimpleMultiplexer</a>
                uses events to give other things a chance to run. This is so
                one stream can't hog the many-to-one direction of the
                multiplexer.</li>
              <li>The <a
                href="../doxygen/classstrmod_1_1strmod_1_1StreamFDModule.html">StreamFDModule</a>
                will be changed to use events to notify interested parties
                about error conditions.</li>
              <li>When signal handling is finished, the signal handler will
                use events to fold signals back into the normal flow of
                control.</li>
              <li>When multi-threading is supported, and the
                InterThreadModule is done, the InterThreadModule will use
                events to notify itself (in the proper thread context) about
                items on the queue.</li>
              <li>Modules that need to destroy themselves (or the modules
                they communicate with) will post an event, and the event will
                do the destruction in order to avoid having this pointers on
                the stack that point to a dead object.</li>
            </ul>
