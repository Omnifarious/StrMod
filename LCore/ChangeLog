	* LCore/RefCountPtrT.h: Removed puzzling use of virtual inheritance.
	Added/changes constructors and assignment operators so the class
	works better and is more complete.

	* LCore/RefCountPtr.h: Seperated out default constructor because
	setting the pointer initially to NULL can be optimized.


	* LCore/HopClTypes.h: Removed pragmas that only made sense to
	Borland's compiler.
