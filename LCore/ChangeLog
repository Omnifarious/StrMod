	* LCore/simple_bitset.h: Include optimizing specializations.

	* LCore/simple_bitset_optim.h, LCore/simple_bitset.h: Removed lots
	of debugging prints.

	* LCore/enum_set.h: Fixed a stupid error (I put in *this instead
	of other :-(.  Removed lots of debugging prints.

	* LCore/simple_bitset.h, LCore/simple_bitset.cxx: Numerous good
	changes to appease AIX's much stricter compiler.  Now much more
	tight about exactly where names are accessible.

2002-03-12  hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.org>

	* LCore/LCoreError.h, LCore/simple_bitset.h: Fixed many small
	things the Solaris compiler doesn't like.  Removed ;'s after the
	closing } of namespaces.  Removed redeclaration of default
	argument values in a few places.

	* LCore/enum_set.h, LCore/simple_bitset.h: More attempts to ferret
	out the problem.  GCC bug?

	* LCore/enum_set.h, LCore/simple_bitset.h,
	LCore/simple_bitset_optim.h, Makefile.in, simple_bitset.cxx: Added
	in new simple_bitset class so I have cleaner bitset code in order
	to debug things.

2002-03-08  hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.org>

	* LCore/enum_set.h: More testing, seems something's wrong with
	STLs bitset.

	* LCore/enum_set.h: Added operator = to try to fix a bug.

2002-03-07  hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.org>

	* LCore/enum_set.h: Fixed a coupld of errors that never showed up
	because the bitwise operator functions had never been
	instantiated.

2002-02-10  hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.org>

	* tests/refcnt.cxx, LCore/enum_set.h, LCore/LCoreError.h,
	objctstr.cxx: More changes to make work better with standard C++.
	Also, added a bit of documentation to try to make doxygen happy.

	* /home/hopper/src/cvs/C++/LCore/ChangeLog, /home/hopper/src/cvs/C++/LCore/cltpsstr.cxx, /home/hopper/src/cvs/C++/LCore/lcerror.cxx, /home/hopper/src/cvs/C++/LCore/LCore/ClassTypes.h, /home/hopper/src/cvs/C++/LCore/LCore/Debugable.h, /home/hopper/src/cvs/C++/LCore/LCore/enum_set.h, /home/hopper/src/cvs/C++/LCore/LCore/LCoreError.h, /home/hopper/src/cvs/C++/LCore/LCore/Object.h:
	Fixed up things to work with new C++ standard library that insists on
	the std:: namespace.  Removed RCS id string because it isn't
	consistently included and of dubious value.

	* Everything: Fixed up things to work with new C++ standard
	library that insists on the std:: namespace.  Removed RCS id
	string because it isn't consistently included and of dubious
	value.

2001-07-05  Eric Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* LCore/enum_set.h: Added copy contructor and ability to convert
	to a string of '1's and '0's.

	* LCore/LCoreError.h, lcerror.cxx: Added ability to send to
	ostream.

2001-07-03  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* LCore/LCoreError.h (_LCORE_LCoreError_H_): Documented double
	inclusion macro to make doxygen stop complaining.

2001-07-02  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* LCore/enum_set.h: Improved const correctness.  Stopped trying to
	use std::bitset::reference improperly.

2001-06-22  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* Makefile.in (LIBCXX): Added source file for new enum_set class.

	* LCore/enum_set.h, enum_set.cxx, tests/test_enum_set.cxx: Added
	enum_set to hold a set of enumerated values.

2001-06-15  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* Makefile.in (LIBCXX): Added source files for new LCoreError
	class.

	* LCore/LCoreError.h, lcerror.cxx: New class for holding error
	conditions in exception and other situations.

2001-03-06  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* libNet-0.2.2 is released.

2000-12-01  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* LCore/RefCountPtrT.h, LCore/RefCountPtr.h: Made some changes
	because Doxygen has difficulties with typedefs.

	* LCore/Debugable.h: Completely worked over the documentation for
	Doxygen.

	* LCore/Protocol.h, defproto.cxx: Added Doxygen documentation.

	* cltpsstr.cxx: Changed include of iostream to new standard C++
	library style.

2000-01-27  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* LCore/RefCounting.h: Made the member variable refcounter mutable
	so even const objects could be reference counted.

1999-11-18  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* Everything: Added copyright notices everywhere!

1999-10-20  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* LCore/SPSClTypes.h:
	* LCore/RefCountPtrT.h:
	* LCore/RefCountPtr.h:
	* LCore/HopClTypes.h:
	* rfcntptr.cxx: Removed all references to <bool.h> and changed all
	references to bool_val and bool_cst to bool.

	* GNUmakefile.in: Removed because now there's Makefile.in

	* Makefile.in: Added the wondrous, splendiferous new makefile that
	reports a list of dependencies to the root level makefile so one,
	big make can be done at the top level.

1999-10-15  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* GNUmakefile.in: Fixed to include stuff the GNUmakefile now
	includes.

	* LCore/RefCountPtr.h: Changed so that a preprocessor flag that
	should disappear after the file is done does disappear.

	* LCore/Protocol.h: Moved the protected section to where it should
	be if it follows coding giudelines.  Added a reference to this
	file.

	* clsprgid.cxx: Added a new class, Debugable.

	* LCore/Debugable.h:
	* debugabl.cxx: Added a new 'Debugable' interface for checking
	class invariants and printing state.

1999-07-20  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* LCore/HopClTypes.h: 
	* LCore/SPSClTypes.h: Removed a whole bunch of operator == that
	were there only to appease buggy compilers.

	* LCore/GenTypes.h: Changed include of sys/byteorder.h to
	netinet/in.h since that more reliably exists and defines the
	hton/ntoh family of macros.
	Added const in a bunch of spots that I thought made sense.

	* LCore/ClassTypes.h: Fixed so that all operator == are no longer
	member functions so type conversion can occur on either argument.

1999-01-17  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* LCore/RefCountPtr.h: Fixed a problem with NDEBUG being defined
	when it shouldn't be.

	* LCore/GenTypes.h: Fixed UNIX U4Byte and S4Byte typedefs to use
	int instead of long if you're compiling on a alpha.  This is in
	lieu of a more comprehensive 64 bit solution.

1999-01-10  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* LCore/RefCountPtrT.h: Removed puzzling use of virtual inheritance.
	Added/changes constructors and assignment operators so the class
	works better and is more complete.

	* LCore/RefCountPtr.h: Seperated out default constructor because
	setting the pointer initially to NULL can be optimized.


	* LCore/HopClTypes.h: Removed pragmas that only made sense to
	Borland's compiler.
