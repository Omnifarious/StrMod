	* LCore/RefCountPtr.h: Fixed a problem with NDEBUG being defined
	when it shouldn't be.

	* LCore/GenTypes.h: Fixed UNIX U4Byte and S4Byte typedefs to use
	int instead of long if you're compiling on a alpha.  This is in
	lieu of a more comprehensive 64 bit solution.

	* LCore/RefCountPtrT.h: Removed puzzling use of virtual inheritance.
	Added/changes constructors and assignment operators so the class
	works better and is more complete.

	* LCore/RefCountPtr.h: Seperated out default constructor because
	setting the pointer initially to NULL can be optimized.


	* LCore/HopClTypes.h: Removed pragmas that only made sense to
	Borland's compiler.
