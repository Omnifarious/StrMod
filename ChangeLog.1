	* Doxyfile: New version number, and a new path to my private copy
	of AT&Ts GraphViz tools.

2002-08-30  Eric Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.org>

	* Lots of stuff: Lots of changes for lcore and ehnet namespaces.
	Some minor updating of style and copyright notices.

2001-07-10  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* Makefile.in: Added 'install' target.

2001-07-04  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* distbin/proclibsrc.pl.in: Fixed the generation of rules.mk to
	handle the way post 2.96 gcc handles the -MD option.  The new
	handling is obviously more correct than the previous handling, so
	the previous way is no longer supported.

2001-03-06  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* libnet-0.2.2 is released.

2000-01-27  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* LCore:
	* UniEvent: Added some member function documentation.
	Fixed various member functions to conform to the 'first letter is
	lowercase' naming conventions.

1999-11-18  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* Everything: Added copyright notices everywhere!

1999-10-20  Eric M. Hopper  <hopper@omnifarious.mn.org>

	* distbin/proclibsrc.pl.in: Added this multipurpose perl script to
	help all the depency collection and filtering to the top level
	make file work.

	* distbin/install-sh: Added this program so that configure would
	always find a BSD compatible install.

	* Makefile.in: Added the wondrous, splendiferous new makefile that
	runs through all the component directories, collects depency
	information, and does one, big make at the top level.

	* configure.in: Added configure.in.  It doesn't really do much yet
	besides set up paths and things, but hopefully that will change.

	* GNUmakefile: Removed because now there's Makefile.in
