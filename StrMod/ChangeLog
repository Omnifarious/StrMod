	* GNUmakefile.in (LIBCCS): Removed two .cc files that were
	specific to a particular application.
	Fixed a number of targets to be in tests, not test.

	* SockListenModule.cc (SockListenModule): Fixed an unnecessary
	cast to caddr_t.
	(inputReady): Made length unsigned, and fixed the way the address
 	buffer for accept was handled.
	Moved revision history around, and set it up so it was no longer
	updated.
